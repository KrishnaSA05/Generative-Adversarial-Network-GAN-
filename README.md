This project represents a comprehensive and meticulous exploration into the integration of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to advance RADAR technology applications. It began with a meticulous phase of data collection using RADAR sensors, ensuring the acquisition of a diverse and representative dataset containing essential classes such as pedestrians, bicycles, and cars. This dataset served as the foundational resource for training and evaluating three distinct GAN architectures: Conditional GANs, Deep Convolutional GANs, and Semi-Supervised GANs.
